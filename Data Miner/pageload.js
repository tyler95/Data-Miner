     File: pageload.js
 Abstract: pageload script.  This script is run in the WebView's JavaScript
 context every time a new web page is loaded into the browser window.  It
 is run at a time during the loading process when it is safe to add
 additional JavaScript definitions to the page's JavaScript context
 but before any scripts contained in the page start to run.  This
 is a good time to add in your own functions that you would like to
 run in the page after it is fully loaded.
  Version: 1.1
