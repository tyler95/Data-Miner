/*
     File: startup.js
 Abstract: startup script.  This script is run 
 in the main Controller's JavaScript context when the program starts
 up (and again if the user chooses to re-evaluate the script).  JavaScript
 functions defined in this file are called as a part of processing different
 actions in the program and they can be customized as needed.
 
 In most Applications, the controller decides what the application
 will do.  In this app, the controller is just a thin shell that
 calls functions defined in this JavaScript and those functions
 tell the application what to do.
